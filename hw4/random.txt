A) Yes, the expression always yields 1. When casting x to the double dx, it will preserve the exact numerical value of x. Therefore casting dx to a float is equivalent to casting x itself to a float since x and dx have the exact same numerical value. Additionally casting an int to a float does not overflow, and while a double to float may overflow, since in this case the double was based of an int's value no overflow will occur.

B) No, the expression does not always yield 1. If x = INT_MIN and y = INT_MAX, x - y will overflow to 1 whereas dx - dy will simply equal some very negative number. This is a question which relies on the -fwrapv flag since otherwise x - y would not be defined.

C) Yes, the expression always yields 1. dx, dy, and dz are all within the range [INT_MIN, INT_MAX]; therefore, the order of their addition will not affect results since the answer can be represented exactly. This question does not rely on -fwrapv.

D) No, the expression does not always yield 1. If x = INT_MAX, y = INT_MAX - 1, and z = INT_MAX - 2, the exact value of the expression dx * dy * dz cannot be stored; therefore, due to rounding, the order of multiplication will make a difference. This question does not rely on -fwrapv.

E) No, the expression does not always yield 1. If x = 0 and z = 1, then dz / dz equals 1 whereas dx / dx equal NaN. This question does not rely on -fwrapv.
